# Tumor Detection-Segmentation App
we wrote 2 deep learning model for classification and segmetation of tumor and i also  create exe GUI application for who wants to use this project but donot have computer knowledge like doctors and medical reaserchers ...
i hope it will useful for you
 
## use GUI Aplication

for using the exe appilcation you can easily download the latest release in github after downloading extract it and run the app_interface_5 and wait for a second and easily use it
GUI Aplication does not need download any dependencies all of them is already exist in github release

### install dependencies
we use 3.11 to wrote this code but pay attention to using 3.7 or latest version of python to run thease code 
you can easily download source code from my github page or if you are familiar with github you can clone the source code in your envirement(better use virtual envierment in these case) 

first tip  : for next step we have to install python library dependencies you can use Requierments.txt file and then open your terminal and change directory to your virtual envierments and use this command for installing all library with one line code : pip install -r Requirements.txt


second tip : also you can download bellow dependencies manually with pip install 

- tensorflow
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- opencv-python
- matplotlib
- pillow
- pandas
- keras
### important file
we have 3 important python file(notebook)
classification-tumor-finall: in this file i implement
